# EasyLeague

## Contributions

**Aly Hirani (35%)**
- Root View Controller (dynamic context switching based on the Auth listener)
- Login and Signup Screens
  - Profile pictures (cropping, uploading, downloading)
- Home Screen
- League Home Screen
- Firebase integration with their Auth, Storage, and Firestore services

**Daniel Deng (25%)**
- Create League Screen
- League model

**Shreyas Konana (20%)**
- Pair programmed with Daniel

**Ishan Phadke (20%)**
- Pair programmed with Aly

## Deviations
- We accomplished our plans to create functional pages (but limited in features) for the Leagues (Home) Screen, League Overview (League Home) Screen, and the Create League Screen.
- Although the Login Screen was initially planned for the Beta release, we already added the ability to log in or sign up with an email and password.

## Notes
- Daniel and Ishan do not have Macs, so they pair programmed with Shreyas and Aly, respectively. They also had a large role in the design and planning phases.
