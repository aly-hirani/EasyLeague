## Deviations
- We accomplished our plans to create functional pages (but limited in features) for the Leagues (Home) Screen, League Overview (League Home) Screen, and the Create League Screen.
- Although the Login Screen was initially planned for the Beta release, we already added the ability to log in or sign up with an email and password.

## Notes
- Ishan dropped the course
- Daniel does not have a Mac, so he pair programmed with Shreyas
